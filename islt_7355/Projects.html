            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>Student Learning Objective (SLO) 1 outlines the ethics and values of the information professions. To master this objective, students need to demonstrate that they understand the history of libraries and the information professions, and the ethics and principles that guide professionals in this field. Areas of concern include intellectual freedom, copyright and intellectual property, and evaluating and analyzing problems within the profession. One item of coursework that aligns with this SLO is a literature review I wrote for Foundations of Library and Information Science titled ‘Silenced History: Cultural Bias and Gaps in the Archival Record’. ‘Silenced History’ analyzes how gaps in the historical records are created, specifically when archives fail to preserve artifacts and knowledge from marginalized communities. The paper reflects on archives developed by queer, indigenous, Black, and Chicanix communities, and suggests major archives can learn from small community archives in how to more fully and accurately represent cultures and groups who exist outside of the mainstream.</p>
            <p>Researching ‘Silenced History’ helped to develop my understanding of how major archives currently operate, and how they can fall short of representing cultural and racial diversity. Archives are more than just storage for historical artifacts. They help people to understand their history, community, and culture. A strength of the paper is its analysis of archives from a variety of marginalized groups and the ways they choose to organize and represent their artifacts. However, I would have liked to go deeper into the benefits of bias-reduction strategies as a solution to racial and cultural absence in major archives acquisitions.</p>

            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p>SLO 2 details the management of information organizations. This objective builds students’ skills in project management, employee management including conflict resolution, and working collaboratively and remotely. The course work that best represents this SLO is a group presentation on archival metadata standards, specifically Encoded Archival Description (EAD). In this project, two classmates and I developed a slideshow presentation on what EAD is and why it has become the chosen metadata standard in archives. As we started the project, we needed to plan out how we could effectively communicate with each other, which included a plan on how to handle conflict or disagreements within the group. Then we worked together to build an outline for the content of the demonstration, as well as a bibliography of relevant resources.</p>
            <p>I enjoyed the classmates I was partnered with, however working collaboratively and remotely can present challenges in communication and organization. We coordinated across time zones in order to schedule meetings and deadlines. We planned out the content of the project and determined how completion of the research and slideshow was going to be split fairly among the three of us. We worked together well, although tasks that did not revolve around content-creation (e.g. reviewing citations, checking for visual consistency) should have been delegated to one person instead of split up. This project provided a lesson in collaboration, group communication, and time management.</p>

            <h3>Project 3</h3>
            <p>SLO 3 handles information technologies and organization, including understanding encoding standards such as Machine-Readable Cataloging (MARC) and HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to create library records or websites. An essay that compares MARC and HTML, which I wrote for the Organization of Information course, aligns with this objective. ‘Machine-Readable or Marked-Up?: A Comparison of MARC and HTML’ breaks down both the similarities and the differences of these two encoding standards. While HTML is standard among any type of webpage development, MARC is used almost exclusively within libraries for record creation. Since each type of coding is used for different outcomes, they look very different from each other. However, as the web has become ubiquitous, there are options to make MARC compatible with HTML in order to create online library catalogs.</p>
            <p>While I had some familiarity with HTML from previous use, MARC is an encoding standard that was introduced to me after becoming a library science major. Learning about different encoding standards at once is daunting, but analyzing and comparing them helped me to better understand the differences in use. Writing this essay was beneficial in learning about major types of encoding standards in the library science field, although I would have liked more hands- on experience with MARC coding to better compare the two standards.</p>

            <h3>Project 4</h3>
            <p>SLO 4 handles access, use, and users, and outlines how future information professionals should plan and design programs for users, evaluating print and electronic sources, and understanding how their profession impacts and works with other fields. Librarians not only recommend books to their patrons, but also create resources for their users. To demonstrate these skills I created an online pathfinder or public library guide (commonly referred to as a LibGuide) that is meant to help users discover information and resources on a particular subject. The subject of my LibGuide is ‘Owning a Dog’, and provides both print and digital resources on dog breeds, puppy rearing, training and behavior, local breeders and adoption shelters, veterinary advice, and options for further reading. </p>
            <p>This project taught me how to anticipate users’ needs when providing information on a subject, and how to build a well-rounded and easily navigable LibGuide. The platform used to create the LibGuide was difficult to manage at first, although it became easier with use. I appreciated the opportunity to develop a digital resource that meets users’ needs. However, I wrote the guide to serve a public library patron in Columbia, MO, and to do it again I may have changed the location to Austin, TX, as I am more familiar with the local resources.</p>
