         <p>I am originally from Kailua, Hawai’i, where I graduated from Windward Community College with an Associate’s degree in Liberal Arts. After a brief transfer to University of Hawai’i, in 2010 I moved to New York, NY, to continue my Bachelor’s degree in History, graduating from CUNY Hunter College in 2014. During this time I also worked at Strand Bookstore, primarily focusing on inventory management and organization. <br/>After graduating from Hunter I moved to Austin, TX, where I earned my credentials to teach secondary education at the Region XIII Educator Certification Program. I taught high school-level Social Studies at Texans Can Academy in Austin for five years, including virtual education during the COVID pandemic. I am excited about this new transition in my career, pursuing my Master’s degree in Library and Information Science with the iSchool of University of Missouri. I hope to blend my love of history and skill at information organization at an archive or museum after graduating.</p>
