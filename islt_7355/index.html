        <p>Hi, my name is Amelia Burlingame, and I’m a library and information science graduate student at the University of Missouri. Use this online portfolio to learn more about my background in high school social studies education and my current studies in library science. The purpose of this website is to document my professional and academic achievements as I transition from the classroom to the library. My goal after earning my master’s degree is to combine these career paths to work in an archive, museum, or academic library.</p>
