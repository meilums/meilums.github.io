        <h4>How It Started...</h4>
        <p>Becoming a graduate student with the iSchool of the University of Missouri has been an exciting next step in my career path. Although I am transitioning into a new field from teaching secondary education, I believe my academic and professional experience thus far has prepared me to work in an archive. I will be blending my background in history with the inventory management skills I picked up as a bookseller, as well as the new skills and knowledge I am gaining as a student of library and information science.</p>
        <p>Studying history as an undergrad student at CUNY Hunter College instilled in me an appreciation for primary artifacts and archival research. While I was enrolled at Hunter, I also worked at Strand Bookstore primarily working in inventory management. This kind of work involves materials organization, attention to detail, and use of a database to manage information. At the time, these two paths did not seem to go together, so when I left New York for Austin upon graduating I decided to go into teaching.</p>
        <p>In the Region XIII Educator Certification Program I received hands-on experience creating lesson plans, adapting materials and resources for the curriculum, and teaching social studies in a public school classroom. While teaching social studies at Austin Can Academy, a public charter high school, I learned how to adapt information for students who had varying levels of knowledge of US history, who spoke English as a second language, or who struggled through reading and learning impairments. This kind of experience taught me to be mindful that a diverse population will have diverse information needs, and how to adapt to meet those needs. Moreover, virtual teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic added another layer to this as I had to navigate teaching to students whose technology skills were at varying levels of proficiency.</p>
        <h4>How It's Going...</h4>
        <p>While teaching I thought more about going back to grad school for library and information science. The University of Missouriâ€™s iSchool LIS program met all of the parameters I was looking for and I decided to take that next step. I have completed two semesters so far and am learning that library science is so much more than I thought it was.</p>
        <p>My academic and professional path have not been a straight line towards a career in the library and information professions, but I believe each step has been complimentary toward the next. Between managing inventory in a bookstore, and studying and teaching history, the transition to working in an archive I believe will be a blend of the skills and knowledge I have gathered along the way. I look forward to learning more about the information professions and how I can make my own impact in this field.</p>
